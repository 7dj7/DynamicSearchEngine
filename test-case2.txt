My balcony is like a small garden indeed
I am sitting on the deck of a fine ship
All the decks are clean for use
The soil under everyone’s feet isn’t like the deck of new ship
The play ground is so big
There are many cricket grounds in India
I am playing the deck at every Sunday
Decked him with one punch 
Decorate a birthday cake
I am sitting on the deck of a fine ship
The soil under everyone’s feet isn’t like the deck of new ship
There are two ships on the dock
Ship the wounded soldiers at their home
A fine nylon thread
A parking fine
She was fined $100 for driving offences
She had certainly fined down her face was thinner
I am sitting on the deck of a fine ship
A special sitting of Basil don Magistrate
The resignation of the sitting member of the parliament
