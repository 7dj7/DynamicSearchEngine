I am sitting on the deck of a fine ship
I am sitting on the deck of a fine ship
I am sitting on the deck of a fine ship
The soil under everyone’s feet isn’t like the deck of new ship
The soil under everyone’s feet isn’t like the deck of new ship
All the decks are clean for use
There are two ships on the dock
Ship the wounded soldiers at their home
Decorate a birthday cake
Decked him with one punch 
I am playing the deck at every Sunday
A fine nylon thread
A parking fine
She had certainly fined down her face was thinner
She was fined $100 for driving offences
A special sitting of Basil don Magistrate
The resignation of the sitting member of the parliament
