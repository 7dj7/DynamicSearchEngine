My balcony is like a small garden indeed
The play ground is so big
All the decks are clean for use
There are many cricket grounds in India
Decked him with one punch 
I am sitting on the deck of a fine ship
She had certainly fined down her face was thinner
I am sitting on the deck of a fine ship
There are two ships on the dock
The soil under everyone’s feet isn’t like the deck of new ship
She was fined $100 for driving offences
I am playing the deck at every Sunday
The soil under everyone’s feet isn’t like the deck of new ship
A special sitting of Basil don Magistrate
Ship the wounded soldiers at their home
I am sitting on the deck of a fine ship
A fine nylon thread
Decorate a birthday cake
The resignation of the sitting member of the parliament
A parking fine
